The [xPack GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/gcc-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64 and arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files can be downloaded automatically with **xpm** or manually
from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC**
on various platforms are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack GCC uses the official sources,
with no functional changes:

- GCC {frontMatter.gcc_version}
- binutils {frontMatter.binutils_version}
- mingw-w64 {frontMatter.mingw_version}
- gdb {frontMatter.gdb_version}

## Supported languages

The supported languages are:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++
- Fortran

Note: Obj-C/C++ support is minimalistic.

Starting with 12.2.0-2, support for 32-bit multilib was added on Intel
Linux; it can be enabled via the `-m32` compile option.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

Please see the separate
[tests results page](/docs/tests/{{releaseVersion}}/).

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from
the project web site:

- https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Checksums

The SHA-256 hashes for the files are:
