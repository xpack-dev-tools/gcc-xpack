## Supported languages

The xPack GCC binaries include support for:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++
- Fortran

Note: Obj-C support is minimalistic.

## Miscellaneous

### `-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++`

To avoid issues with shared libraries, specific to toolchains installed
in custom locations, it is highly recommended to use only the
static versions of the GCC libraries.

For this append `-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++` to the linker line.
