Given that the GCC project continues to maintain older versions for several
years, **xPack GCC** will also release updates for previous versions.
For example, after releasing the new **{versionMajor()}.2**, updates for
the previous three versions - **{versionMajor() - 1}.3**, **{versionMajor() - 2}.4**, **{versionMajor() - 3}.5** - will also be released.
