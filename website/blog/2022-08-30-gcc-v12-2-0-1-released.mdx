The [xPack GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/gcc-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64, arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack GCC** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack GCC generally follows the official
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) releases.

The current version is based on:

- GCC version [12.2.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-12/) from Aug 19, 2022;
- binutils version
[2.38](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2022-02/msg00009.html)
from Feb 9, 2022.

## Supported languages

The supported languages are:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++

Note: Obj-C/C++ support is minimalistic.

Starting with August 2022, support for 32-bit multilib was added on x86
GNU/Linux; it can be enabled via the `-m32` compile option.

## Documentation

To save space and bandwidth, the original GNU GCC documentation is available
[online](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022 and the
minimum requirement was raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
