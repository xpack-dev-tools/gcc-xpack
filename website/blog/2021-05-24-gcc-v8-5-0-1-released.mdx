Version 8.5.0-1 is the first release of **xPack GCC**.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

The [xPack GCC](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/gcc-xpack/)
is the **xPack** distribution of the
[GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/gcc@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

On macOS, the general build tools are available in the
**Command Line Tools** package, which can be installed standalone or
as part of Xcode.

## Compliance

This release follows the official
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) release.

## Supported languages

The supported languages are:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++
- Fortran

## Changes

Compared to the GNU version, there should be no functional changes.

The only patch applied was to make it correctly
recognise macOS version 11.x instead of 10.16;
the code was copied from the more recent
11.x sources.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- on macOS, the g++ compiler complains about something like _... the weak
symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different
translation units being compiled with different visibility settings_.
The reason for triggering this warning was not identified (yet), but the
resulting binaries seem functional.

### macOS binutils

The GNU binutils are not compatible with the macOS linker and are not included
in the macOS archive.

### macOS SDK

For the package to be standalone, the `MacOSX10.10.sdk` folder
includes the 10.10 SDK.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

TBD

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 11.2.

The tests consist in building simple hello world programs.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by GNU, the
long and complex tests performed by GNU to validate their release were not
executed again.
