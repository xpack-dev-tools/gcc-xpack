[The xPack GCC](https://xpack.github.io/gcc/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (Intel 64-bit),
**macOS** (Intel 64-bit, Apple Silicon 64-bit)
and **GNU/Linux** (Intel 64-bit, Arm 32/64-bit).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={ frontMatter.download_url }>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux Intel 64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- GNU/Linux Arm 32/64-bit: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- Intel Windows 64-bit: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- Intel macOS 64-bit: 10.13 or later
- Apple Silicon macOS 64-bit: 11.6 or later

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GCC** on various platforms
are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack GCC generally follows the official
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) releases.

The current version is based on:

- GCC version [13.2.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/) from July 27, 2023;
- binutils version
[2.41](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2023-07/msg00009.html)
from July 30, 2023.

## Supported languages

The supported languages are:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++
- Fortran

Note: Obj-C/C++ support is minimalistic.

Starting with 12.2.0-2, support for 32-bit multilib was added on Intel
Linux; it can be enabled via the `-m32` compile option.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- [[#8]](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/issues/8) due to
an error in the binutils build script, in certain conditions, on Linux,
the linker complained about a dependency to `libpthread.so` and/or
`libm.so`; fixed.

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

To save space and bandwidth, the original GNU GCC documentation is available
[online](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer-info/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### Linux minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is **GLIBC 2.27**, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022.

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows was
dropped in 2022.

### Pre-deprecation notice for 32-bit Arm Linux

Due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems,
support for 32-bit Arm Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a little while, but expect it to be dropped by 2025,
so it is recommended to consider an upgrade to a RPi 4 or 5 with
at least 4 GB (preferably 8 GB) of RAM.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
